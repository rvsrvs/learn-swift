# To Do

* Add a separate playground on all forms of map culminating in map on a new function type
* Add a separate playground on all forms of zip culminating in zip on a new function type
* Add a separate playground on all forms of flatMap culminating in flatMap on a new function type
* Do a separate playground on contraMap, using Predicate as an example. Show that it is a characteristic of generics over functions
* Add a playground on contraFlatMap continuing to use Predicate as the example
* Add a separate playground on dimap as the composition of a contraMap and a map.
* Carry the preceding playgrounds into a playground on the Func type.  Provid std forms of map, flatmap, contramap, contraflatmap, dimap, invmap
* Do a separate playground on Protocol Witnesses explaining existential types, work through mechanically getting rid of protocols altogether
* Show the complete interaction between base functions, Func and CallAsFunction to produce the FunctionalProgramming.swift playground
* Do a playground on KeyPath and Binding and show how they are alike. In particular show that the compose getters and setters
* Do a playground on point-free style showing intermixing keypaths and functions. Explain the point-free style is all about composing the functions without application until the very end
* Add a playground on zip(with:) as Applicative, putting a step in between map and flatMap
* Replace existing Higher Order Functions III with a playground on Free Combine using the above.
* Add Asynchrony to Free Combine
* Add a playground showing how higher-order functions on types replace imperative language constructs:

  1. for-loops -> Sequence
  2. while-loops -> Trampoline
  3. throws -> Result
  4. call-backs -> Publisher
  5. inheritance -> Func via currying
  6. wait -> Future/Promise

* Add KeyPaths and Bindings to the base swift material
* Add CallAsFunction to the base swift material
* Add a playground on function dispatch to the base material
* Incorporate `@escaping` to the base material
* Incorporate `inout` to the base material
* Add a playground on invmap to show the extension to Reducers
* Review current version of `The Swift Programming Language` for missed items.
* Add a playground on variadic functions
